```
$ mt --help

Usage: mt [Options] [Exchange1.Token1 Exchange2.Token2.<api_key> ...]

Track token prices of your favorite exchanges in the terminal

Options:
  -v, --Version                            Show Version number
  -d, --debug                              Enable debug mode
  -l, --list-exchanges                     List supported exchanges
  -r, --refresh int                        Auto refresh on every specified seconds, note every exchange has a rate limit,
                                           too frequent refresh may cause your IP banned by their servers
  -c, --config-file string                 Config file path, use "--example-config-file <path>" to generate an example config file,
                                           by default my-token uses "my_token.yml" in current directory or $HOME as config file
      --example-config-file string[="-"]   Generate example config file to the specified file path, by default it outputs to stdout
  -s, --show strings                       Only show comma-separated columns (default [Symbol,Price,%Change(1h),%Change(24h),Source,Updated])
  -p, --proxy string                       Proxy used when sending HTTP request
                                           (eg. "http://localhost:7777", "https://localhost:7777", "socks5://localhost:1080")
  -t, --timeout int                        HTTP request timeout in seconds (default 20)

Space-separated exchange.token pairs:
  Specify which exchange and token pair to query, different exchanges use different forms to express tokens/trading pairs, refer to their URLs to find the format (eg. "Bitfinex.BTCUSDT"). Optionally you can set api_key in the third place.

```

* #### Display latest market prices for for `BNBUSDT`, `BTCUSDT` from `Binance` and `HTUSDT` from `Huobi`

```bash
$ mt binance.BNBUSDT binance.BTCUSDT Huobi.HTUSDT
```

Here `Binance` and `Huobi` can be replaced by any supported exchanges, and different exchanges use different forms to
express tokens/symbols/markets, refer to their URLs to find the format.

* #### Auto-refresh on every 10 seconds

```bash
$ mt -r 10 binance.BNBUSDT binance.BTCUSDT Huobi.HTUSDT
```

NOTE: some exchanges has a strict rate limit, too frequent refresh may cause your IP banned by their servers.

* #### Show specified columns only

```bash
$ mt --show Symbol,Price binance.BTCUSDT
```

See issue [#3](https://github.com/polyrabbit/my-token/issues/3) for a discussion on this feature.

* #### Run with options from a configuration file

```bash
$ mt -c my_token.example.yaml
```

my-token can also read options from configuration file, see the attached [my_token.example.yaml](my_token.example.yaml)
for its format. By default my-token searches configuration file `my_token.yml` in current directory and `$HOME`, so you
can compose a `my_token.yml`, place it in your `$HOME` and just type `mt` to get all pre-defined prices.

```bash
$ # Generate an example config file to my $HOME directory
$ mt --example-config-file=$HOME/my_token.yml
$
$
$ # my-token will search for configuration file "my_token.yml" in current directory and "$HOME" by default
$ mt       # <--- This is also the way I used most freqently 
```
